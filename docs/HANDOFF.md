# Handoff

## State

- Full build MATCH (SHA-1 `10dcd21be9c5542e82b0b94473bf5ff569b36cf5`); `tools/verify_all.sh` MATCH.
- bank80_8000, bank80_9000 and bank80_A000 are source (MATCH); the other 253 segments are incbin. bank80_A000 starts at
  $809FF5 and ends at $80B000; bank80_B000 starts at $80B001 (incbin from byte 1).
- `src/inc/snes_regs.asm` (from 93S) and `src/ram94snes.asm` are included at the top of `src/nhl94snes.asm`.
- bank80_8000 still has many auto `CODE_` labels and raw RAM addresses: no 93S/94G match, left for a naming pass.
- bank80_9000: math, sine, sound driver commands and the heap, named from what the code does. Left raw: the direct-page
  math scratch ($00-$0B, $3E-$46) and $07E1/$07E2 (bit 6 of $07E2 makes the fraction multiplies skip the mode 7
  multiplier). The sound command numbers are the driver's; their meaning needs the SPC side.
- bank80_A000: the music/sound effect player. Entry points, tables and four RAM flags are named; the sequencer internals
  (voice allocation, track command interpreter $D9-$EA, envelopes) and the per-voice RAM tables ($0804-$0A09) are auto
  labels / raw addresses for a naming pass. The routines from $80AEE1 on (bank $7E buffers at $2100-$3093, called from
  many places) continue into bank80_B000 and are not traced.
- Next: segment bank80_B000 (see `SEGMENT_AGENT.md`, `PROMPT.md`).

## Setup notes

- asar 1.91 on PATH or in `tools/bin/` (`tools/setup.sh`). Python 3.
- ROM at `lst/nhl94snes.sfc` (gitignored). `Extracted/` and `output/` are generated and gitignored.
- The Vault's export (patches off) differs from this ROM in 344 bytes inside $D8000-$FFFFF; the quick pass only uses its code map
  where the bytes decode the same way.
- Windows: `python3` may be the Microsoft Store stub; put a `python3` wrapper for the real Python first on PATH before
  `./build.sh` in Git Bash, or use `build.ps1`.
