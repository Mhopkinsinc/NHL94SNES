# Handoff

## State

- Full build MATCH (SHA-1 `10dcd21be9c5542e82b0b94473bf5ff569b36cf5`); `tools/verify_all.sh` MATCH.
- bank80_8000 is source (MATCH); the other 255 segments are incbin. bank80_9000 now starts at $809002.
- `src/inc/snes_regs.asm` (from 93S) and `src/ram94snes.asm` are included at the top of `src/nhl94snes.asm`.
- bank80_8000 still has many auto `CODE_` labels and raw RAM addresses: no 93S/94G match, left for a naming pass.
- Next: segment bank80_9000 (see `SEGMENT_AGENT.md`, `PROMPT.md`).

## Setup notes

- asar 1.91 on PATH or in `tools/bin/` (`tools/setup.sh`). Python 3.
- ROM at `lst/nhl94snes.sfc` (gitignored). `Extracted/` and `output/` are generated and gitignored.
- The Vault's export (patches off) differs from this ROM in 344 bytes inside $D8000-$FFFFF; the quick pass only uses its code map
  where the bytes decode the same way.
